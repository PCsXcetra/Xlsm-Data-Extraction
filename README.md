# Xlsm-Data-Extraction
2 tools for extracting the decimal values from macro sheet and the decoder to string
Passwords for the two file is "clean'

ConvFromDecCharCode is the tool for converting from a decimal array to a string.
Parse_XLSM_MacroSheet_Value_Data is the tool for extracting just the "Value" data from a macrosheet or a worksheet and then outputing them as comma delimited values.
This tool is useful to me for when the amount of data in a sheet is overwelming.
